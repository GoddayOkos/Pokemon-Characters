# Pokemon-Characters
## Problem Description

Fetch information from the server.

## Implementation 1 :
Using the api provided on https://pokeapi.co/ build an application that shows a list of all the pokemon characters and their pictures with a nice looking UI.

When a pokemon character is clicked it should lead to a page with full details of the character pulled from the appropriate endpoint with all images, move, abilities, stats etc showing at different sections.

## Expectation:

· Show appropriate information for appropriate endpoint

· You app should not crash when network is turned off

· I should be able to set the limit of information I wish to see

## Implementation 2:

An endpoint will be provided to you. Your app should select an image from your gallery and upload said image to the server and return a success or fail message

## Expectation:

· Ask for permission when app is launched

· If permission is denied display an error message in a textfield

· There should be a button to ask again if permission is denied
